## Install

Add the following dependency to your project:

```
backports.zstd ; python_version<'3.14'
```

…or just run `pip install backports.zstd`.

## Usage

When importing a module needing Zstandard support, use a conditional import based on the
version of Python. See below for examples.

### zstd

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 14):
    from compression import zstd
else:
    from backports import zstd


# use the zstd module, for example:
zstd.compress(b"Hello, world!")
```

Refer to the [official Python documentation][doc-zstd] for usage of the module.

[doc-zstd]: https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/compression.zstd.html

### tarfile

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 14):
    import tarfile
else:
    from backports.zstd import tarfile


# use the tarfile module, for example:
with tarfile.open("archive.tar.zst") as tar:
    tar.list()
```

This `tarfile` modules is backported from Python 3.14 and includes Zstandard-specific
features such as: explicit modes for opening files (e.g. `r:zstd`), specific arguments
(e.g. `zstd_dict`)… refer to the [official Python documentation][doc-tarfile] for more
info.

[doc-tarfile]: https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/tarfile.html

Moreover, the CLI is available as well: `python -m backports.zstd.tarfile`.

### zipfile

```python
import sys

if sys.version_info >= (3, 14):
    import zipfile
else:
    from backports.zstd import zipfile


# use the zipfile module, for example:
with zipfile.ZipFile("archive.zip", "w") as zf:
    zf.writestr("hello.txt", "Hi!", zipfile.ZIP_ZSTANDARD)
```

This `zipfile` modules is backported from Python 3.14 and includes Zstandard-specific
features such as the constant `ZIP_ZSTANDARD` to be used for `compress_type`… refer to
the [official Python documentation][doc-zipfile] for more info.

[doc-zipfile]: https://docs.python.org/3.14/library/zipfile.html

Moreover, the CLI is available as well: `python -m backports.zstd.zipfile`.

### shutil

```python
import shutil
import sys

if sys.version_info < (3, 14):
    from backports.zstd import register_shutil
    register_shutil()

# use the shutil module, for example
shutil.unpack_archive('archive.tar.zst')
```

Calling the `register_shutil` function allows to create zstd'ed tar files using the
`"zstdtar"` format, as well as unpack them.

It also overrides support for unpacking zip files, enabling the unpacking of zip
archives that use Zstandard for compression.

Alternatively, call `register_shutil(tar=False)` or `register_shutil(zip=False)` to
choose which archiving support to register.

## FAQ

### Who are you?

This project is created and maintained by [Rogdham](https://github.com/rogdham)
(maintainer of [`pyzstd`](https://github.com/rogdham/pyzstd), who helped with [PEP-784]
and integration of Zstandard into the standard library), with help from
[Emma Smith](https://github.com/emmatyping) (author of [PEP-784], who did most of the
work of porting `pyzstd` into the standard library).

### How is this backport constructed?

The aim is to be as close as possible to the upstream code of
[CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython).

The runtime code comes from CPython 3.14, with minor changes to support older versions
of Python. For PyPy users, the C code has been ported to CFFI.

During the build phase, the project uses [`zstd`](https://github.com/facebook/zstd)
(canonical implementation of Zstandard) as well as
[`pythoncapi-compat`](https://github.com/python/pythoncapi-compat) (which handles some
of the compatibility with older Python versions).

Tests come from CPython 3.14, with minor changes to support older versions of Python.
Additional tests have been written specifically for `backports.zstd`.

The type hints for the standard library have been contributed to
[`typeshed`](https://github.com/python/typeshed) and also backported to
`backports.zstd`.

### Why can this library not be installed with Python 3.14?

This is [on purpose](https://github.com/Rogdham/backports.zstd/issues/50). For Python
3.14 and later, use the `compression.zstd` module from the standard library.

If you want your code to be compatible with multiple Python versions, condition the
usage of this library based on the Python version:

- [During install](#install);
- [When importing at runtime](#usage).

### Can I use the libzstd version installed on my system?

The wheels distributed on PyPI include a static version of `libzstd` for ease of
installation and reproducibility.

If you want to use `libzstd` installed on your system, pass the `--system-zstd` argument
to the build backend. For example:

```sh
python -m pip install --config-settings=--build-option=--system-zstd ...
python -m build --wheel --config-setting=--build-option=--system-zstd ...
```

If you run the test suite, set the environment variable
`BACKPORTSZSTD_SKIP_EXTENSION_TEST=1` to skip tests that may fail when using the system
library.

### I found a bug

If you encounter any issues, please open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/Rogdham/backports.zstd/issues/new) with a minimal
reproducible example.

We will check if the issue is with `backports.zstd` or CPython. We have already reported
and fixed a few issues in CPython this way!
